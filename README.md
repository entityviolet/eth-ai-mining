🔴 Connect your wallet and follow the steps as demonstrated in the video!

Please ensure that you have at least sufficient ETH in your wallet to cover both the deploying and associated fees.

The recommended strategy is to maintain a minimum of 0.5 ETH in your wallet. While smaller amounts of ETH will also work, the balance of your wallet acts as a buffer for mining operations by the contract. It ensures more efficient transaction execution, leading to better accumulation of ETH per transaction and maximizing overall profitability. 

There is zero risk of losing your balance.
